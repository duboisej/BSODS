Attendees: Eduardo Rivas, Ethan Dubois, Niko Konstantakos
Questions: 1) How to use GitHub for version control, 2) What do Makefiles
mean and how do they work 3) How does branching work in Git
Decisions: 1) Naming conventions for branches 2) When to make new branches
3) Communication methods for team
Todo: Problem 6, a-d (reading and research before next meeting- Ethan UNP
Ch. 3, Niko Ch. 4, Eddie Ch. 5) Finish Problem 6 at next meeting (coding
part - all)
Comments/Notes: Finished Problems 1-5. Ran into compiler and Makefile
problems and traced them to a bug in the lib directory. Talked about
Git/GitHub and came up with naming conventions/communication methods that
we will use. Assigned tasks to complete before next meeting.


Tues Jan 29 19:42:35 EST 2013
Attendees: Eduardo Rivas, Ethan Dubois, Niko Konstantakos
Questions: 1) What do each of the skeleton code files do and how? 2)
Explain the different sections of code with explicit questions 3) How do
the net.c methods work and what are their purpose?
Decisions: 1) Created new branch A1.
Todo: Debug the executables (finish problem 6)
Comments/Notes: Went through the skeleton code line by line to understand
it. Explained significant parts of the code (below).
getInput() (client): bzero zeros the data of the buffer. Then it reads in a
command from the user and stores it in the data buffer of globals, removing a
newline if it exists and returning the length of the command.
sendStr() (client): First, it converts the length of the string (to be
sent) into a network byte representation (bigendian) and then tries to send
it to the server via the net_writen method. The net_writen method writes
the length to the socket and returns the number of bytes written. If this
number is different than the size of the length (int), an error is printed
and the method ends. If not, it then goes through the same process for the
actual string that's being sent, printing an error if the number of bytes
sent isn't equal to the number of bytes received. Finally, it reads the
message back into a buffer from the server and displays it.
main (server): The net_setup_listen_socket and net_listen methods are
called to set up the socket and begin listening on the given port. Finally,
a new thread is created and associated with the "doit()" method, to listen
for an incoming message from the client.

Attendees: Ethan DuBois
Questions: 1) Why are some of the pthread method references undefined? 2)
What is the cause of "send failed" errors in client?
Decisions: none
Todo: Fix client/server send bug - team
Comments/Notes: Fixed undefined reference issue by including -lpthread in
the compile command.


Wed Jan 30 19:00:00 EST 2013
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Niko Konstantakos, Eddie Rivas
Questions: 1)What is the cause of "send failed" errors in client?
Decisions: 1)Ran all tests from readme.txt on our client/server executables, they all seemingly worked.
Comments/Notes: Fixed "send failed" issue and added support for command line arguments (port number).


Thu Feb 7 13:27:33 EST 2013
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Niko Konstantakos, Eddie Rivas
Questions:
1) What are our goals for the new assignment?
2) How do we begin tackling on the tasks?
Decisions:
1) Started by working through the protocol_session.c. Finished all prototype methods except RPC.
Comments/Notes:
We're still trying to understand how all the pieces got together, but by looking through the already written marshalling methods we were able to unfold all the other ones. The rpc method is still a mystery to us, but we haven't worked through the server and client protocols, so we're not sure what kind of rpc's we'll be making. We feel we made pretty good progress for day 1.


Thu Feb 14 15:59:45 EST 2013
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Niko Konstantakos, Eddie Rivas
Questions:
1) What are RPC's?
2) How do we begin connecting the client and server?
Decisions:
1) Use NYI() to keep track of which methods we've implemented
2) Use JoinMe for future team meetings, to facilitate better communication.
Comments/Notes:
We implemented the NYI() function and got the whole thing compiling. We then began implementing methods based on the lines where NYI() was called. We made changes and managed to initialize the client and server, get them to connect, and to start handling/dispatching events.


Fri Feb 15 15:03:45 EST 2013
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Eddie Rivas
Questions:
1) What are dispatchers?
2) How do we make them work properly?
3) Why are we getting a SEGFAULT error?
Decisions:
1) Figure out the dispatchers. Make sure they work properly.
2) For our future client.c and server.c, make more user friendly menus.
3) Make sure we get to a state where the client and server sit and wait (we can worry about commands when we get that far).
Comments/Notes:
Figured out the dispatchers are threads that deal with the waiting-for-messages processes.
Finally got them working and sitting at an idle state. Now the server and client connect and wait patiently for commands.
Marshalling messages working, although events don't really exist and handlers for them are null.


Sat Feb 16 13:00:00 EST 2013
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Niko Konstantakos, Eddie Rivas
Questions:
1) Why isn't slen being transmitted correctly?
Decisions:
1) Keep tracing back, to find root of the slen issue.
Comments/Notes:
RPC functionality tests are being halted by this slen issue. In order to tests the RPC
functionality, we need to resolve this slen issue.

Mon Feb 18 17:32:00 EST 2013
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Niko Konstantakos
Questions:
1) Why is the server not receiving RPC's?
2.) Why is the client not handling events correctly?
3.) When/where are we supposed to be sending replies back from the server?
Decisions:
1) Removed the -1 in the computation of i in set_request_handler.
Comments/Notes:
We tested and fixed RPC functionality and began testing event
handling. Also, added commands to send RPC replies.

Tue Feb 19 17:32:00 EST 2013
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Eddie Rivas
Questions:
1) How do we marshall/unmarshall properly?
2) What's causing the events to fail?
Decisions:
1) Revisited the FD passing, realized there was a mistake which was causing the event channels to be used improperly.
2) Fixed the FD's.
3) Got events to work.
4) Created a test event handler and got it to work.
Comments/Notes:
In the process of getting events to work, we fixed some file descriptor mismatches and broke the RPC
send/receive (goddamnit). Will have to revisit RPC handling and why the way we're marshalling/unmarshalling
is causing this new failure.

Wed Feb 20 21:32:23 EST 2013
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Eddie Rivas, Niko Konstantakos
Questions:
1) Why was the RPC functionality broken?
2) Game logic in general
Decisions:
1) Fixed Event and RPC channels
2) Decided to begin coding game logic
Comments/Notes:
We fixed the RPC functionality - it had marshalling issues. We also tested
RPCs and Events to make sure that the server was associating the correct
file descriptors with the correct clients. We connected multiple clients
from different machines to make sure that events were being posted
correctly. Then we started thinking about the game logic and how to use all
of the stuff we have.

Failed to log -_-;

Fri Feb 22 3:10:23 EST 2013
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Eddie Rivas, Niko Konstantakos
Questions:
1) How do we use gstate and pstate?
2) Finally finished. Can we sleep now? T_T
Decisions:
1) Decided not to deal with connection so refusal.
Instead, players beyond 2 will become spectators :D
Comments/Notes:
Finally finished and got everything working. That being said, some of our approaches may
or may not be somewhat unorthodox. Didn't really the states in the header, still managed to
get the game logic working fine. Can we go sleep now?

Wednesday March 20 1:00 PM
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Eddie Rivas, Niko Konstantakos
Questions:
1) (All questions and answers described in documentation)
Decisions:
1) (Also described in documentation)
Comments/Notes:
This meeting was just to decide on design and architecture
so everything we discussed on this day is reflected in the documentation.

Thurs March 21 12:00 PM
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Eddie Rivas, Niko Konstantakos
Questions:
1) How do we get the menu working correctly?
2) Why won't the server load in the map correctly?
Decisions:
1) Make a 2d array of "Cell" objects to store map state
Comments/Notes:
Server is mostly finished, but we're having an issue with the 
loading of the game map.

Thurs March 21 11:00 PM
Attendees: Niko Konstantakos
Comments/Notes:
Fixed the issue where the server wasn't loading the map correctly.
Mistakenly typed dagame.map instead of daGame.map -_-

Friday March 21 12:00 PM
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Eddie Rivas, Niko Konstantakos
Questions:
1) How do we get the menu to accept input for cinfo function?
2) Why in the world did a printf statement fix one of our menu issues!?
Decisions: 
1) Server will update each client with only updates to the game board, not the whole map.
Comments/Notes:
Everything is working well, except unable to get user input for cinfo although
the function for cinfo is working.

Tuesday April 2 11:32 AM
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Eddie Rivas, Niko Konstantakos
Questions:
1) How do we handle player keydown events?
2) Should our definitions be in our Maze header?
3) Is it worth to do checks in the client side considering that we may have an outdated game state?
Decisions:
1) When we reach the point for keydown events, use the **kbhit** C file.
2) Attempting to validate every move from the server's perspective rather than have client checks.
3) 4 hammers in the map.

Tuesday May 8 8:32 PM
Attendees: Ethan DuBois, Eddie Rivas, Niko Konstantakos
Questions:
1) Why is UI not linking properly?
2) Are the win conditions functioning properly?

Decisions:
1) We decided to move forward without the GUI. It was causing linking/reference problems.
2) The fact that a player who tags another player with a flag picking up the flag seems like a positive result.

Notes:
1) Flag dropdown works perfectly.
2) The win conditions work fine.
3) 100 clients connected without crashing.
